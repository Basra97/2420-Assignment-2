# This will set the path to the packages list file

packages=./list_packages.txt

# This checks if the packages file exists and if it does not it will print an error message and exit
if [[ ! -f $packages ]]; then
  echo "Packages list $packages not found"
  # if the file is missing, it will print a message and exit
  exit 1
fi

# This will loop through each package listed in the packages.txt file
while read -r package_list; do
   # Checks if the package is already installed
  if pacman -Qs "$package_list" > /dev/null; then
  
    # If the package is found, print it is already installed
    echo "$package_list has already been installed"
  else
  # If the package is not found, then install the package
    echo "installing $package_list"
    # This installs package without having to confirm
    pacman -S --noconfirm "$package_list"
